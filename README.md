# HTML-Signature-Generator
Global HTML signature generator mainly for Outlook

After compilation, you need to put your model file along the *.exe named "modele" without extention.
I use some keyword to modify the model :

\<nom> -> Your name <br />
\<prenom> -> Your firstname <br />
\<telephone> -> Your phone number <br />
\<fonction> -> Your function <br />
\<service> -> Your Service <br />
\<fonctionEN> -> Your function in English <br />
\<serviceEN> -> You service in English <br />

Use those keyword in your model file or then you will have to modify source code to your purpose.

For now, it will works only with outlook.
